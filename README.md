Visualizing [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) earthquake data using D3 and Leaflet

by Jason Estrada

This activity is broken into two parts.

## Part 1 - Create Earthquake Visualization
Using the feed for [All Earthquakes in Past 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), an interactive map was created with D3.js and Leaflet.js libraries, with markers showing:
- depth of earthquake in green/red color scale
- marker size based on magnitude of earthquake
- on click, popup showing magnitude, depth, and location short description
A legend was also created to identify the depth's color scale.

## Part 2 - Gather/Plot More Data
A second dataset will be plotted to show the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

At this time, part 2 hasn't been updated yet.
